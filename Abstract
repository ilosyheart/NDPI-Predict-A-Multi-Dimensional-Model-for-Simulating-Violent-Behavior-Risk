# NDPI-Predict-A-Multi-Dimensional-Model-for-Simulating-Violent-Behavior-Risk
Societal and individual security is deeply affected by violent behavior, which has been consistently linked to Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits. These traits, characterized by reduced empathy and guilt, are associated with structural and functional brain differences, including decreased gray matter in the paralimbic cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as weakened connectivity in empathy-related networks. Additionally, childhood trauma and heightened reactivity to violence may exacerbate CU-related tendencies, further elevating the risk of aggression and premeditated harm. Drawing on the NPDI model, this study investigates the pathways from CU traits to violent behavior, with particular attention to sex differences. To assess risk, we developed a machine learning model integrating neural biomarkers (gray matter volume, functional connectivity, amygdala reactivity), personality measures, and sex. Results reveal a clear distinction between high- and low-risk groups, demonstrating the modelâ€™s potential utility in identifying individuals at elevated risk for violence. These findings highlight the interplay of neurobiological and personality factors in CU traits and suggest practical applications in forensic risk assessment.
